        "content": "In a bid to separate its mobile operating system from Google's parent Alphabet, Apple is taking steps to update its maps, search feature and advertising, a report by the Financial Times said. The two rivals have been in the smartphone market since the 2000s and are engaged in a 'silent war', it added. In 2012, Apple released its 'Maps' to compete with Google Maps. After initial glitches, the application has shown considerable changes in the past decade.Earlier this month, Apple announced 'Business Connect' which allows companies to claim their legal location. It also allows them to provide exclusive offers and promotions to their customers and interact with the users. Google Maps partners with Yelp to offer similar information. But with Apple's integration using Apple Pay, Business Connect might get an upper hand in the competition, the report said.Apple's search feature was augmented in 2019 after the purchase of Laserlike, an artificial intelligence start-up. According to experts, Apple could also grab a big share of Google's dominance in the search market by not making it the default search engine in iOS. However, this might come at a cost initially as Google pays Apple $8 billion to $12 billion a year to be the default search engine. The biggest impact will be from Apple's online advertising. Apple appointed Keith Weisburg in September 2022 as the group product manager of Ad platforms. His main role is believed to be to 'drive the design of the most privacy-forward, sophisticated demand side platform possible'. A demand-side platform is a digital media buying tool that lets advertisers purchase ad inventory on multiple exchanges, FT said. This could allow Apple to make a new ad network and keep the third-party data brokers away from it. According to Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, as reported by FT, Apple's move has left Alphabet 'more vulnerable'.'Apple is increasingly incentivised to get into the search business as it builds out its advertising arm...Search is the key to huge troves of first-party data, and that's the new battleground for the future of digital advertising,' he said."

        "content": `Minecraft's 1.20 update may still be quite some time away, but fortunately, the preview snapshots give players some insight into what's to come. Java Edition snapshot 23w04a was recently released, If Minecraft players are hoping to implement armor trims or upgrade their diamond armor to netherite, smithing templates are a surefire way to do so. However, these items aren't craftable, so Survival Mode players will have to find them as loot items instead.
                    Fortunately, once players have a few smithing templates, they can replicate them without needing to hunt down more copies.
                    In total, there are 12 smithing templates as of Minecraft Java snapshot 23wo4a. 11 of the them are different designs for armor trims, and the final one is used to upgrade diamond gear into netherite.
                    Additional templates may come along in future updates, but this is currently what players have to work with. Each template can be found in a different generated structure, and elder guardians can occasionally drop one randomized trim template upon death.
                    Where to Find Each Smithing Template in Minecraft Snapshot 23wo4a
                    Netherite Upgrade - Bastion remnant chestsCoast Armor Trim - Shipwreck chestsDune Armor Trim - Desert pyramid chestsEye Armor Trim - Stronghold chestsRib Armor Trim - Nether fortress chestsSentry Armor Trim - Pillager outpost chestsSnout Armor Trim - Bastion remnant chestsSpire Armor Trim - End city chestsTide Armor Trim - Ocean monument chestsVex Armor Trim - Woodland mansion chestsWard Armor Trim - Ancient city chestsWild Armor Trim - Jungle temple chests
                    Once Minecraft players have the smithing template they need, they'll also need a piece of armor they'd like to customize or upgrade as well as the necessary materials to make the change. Armor trims can use various different materials to change their coloration and sheen, but smithing templates for upgrading diamond to netherite will require one netherite ingot.`

NBA YoungBoy linked up with rapper OG3Three Never Broke Again, a Baton Rouge native, where YoungBoy grew up as well. They worked on their projects together and paid for their production costs via acts of criminality.
        NBA YoungBoy and his crew continue to be linked with various criminal offenses.
        NBAYoungBoy has made headlines for the right reasons and for as many wrong reasons during his rapping career. He initially took that path to cover his production costs. Despite his steady rise and success, the rapper couldn't help himself from staying out of trouble.         
        He was charged with robbery and was sent to juvenile detention (2014) and charged with attempted murder (2016). In 2019, YoungBoy was charged with assault, carrying weapons, kidnapping, and battery lawsuit.
        Over the last three years, he has been arrested for public shooting, gun and drug possession, and probation violations. Most recently, he was arrested on a federal firearms charge. NBA YoungBoy was released from jail for the offense in 2021 after paying $1.5 million as bail.
        He was found not guilty in July 2022 for the offense after a lack of evidence linking him to intentionally possessing the weapons discovered. NBA LilPap, a former associate of YoungBoy, recently entered a plea deal with the prosecution to reduce the murder charge from 2017 to an accessory charge, with a reduced sentence of five years in prison.`
